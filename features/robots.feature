  As a player
  I want to play a game with robots so I don't wait forever for other players

  Scenario: I ask my first robot opponent for cards he has
    Given a game with one real player and one robot
    And it is my turn
    When I ask my first opponent for cards he has
    Then I get the cards
    And it is still my turn

  @javascript
  Scenario: I ask my first robot opponent for cards he does not have
    Given a game with one real player and one robot
    And it is my turn
    And I have a card my first opponent does not
    When I ask my first opponent for cards he does not have
    Then I go fishing
    And it becomes my first opponent's turn

    Given a game with one real player and two robots
    And it is my first opponent's turn
